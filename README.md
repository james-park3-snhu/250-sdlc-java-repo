How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
- In the context of SDLC methodologies like Scrum, I would rely on a Product Owner to engage stakeholders, survey their needs, use prototypes/wireframes in discussion, clarify the benefits desired from the program, drive prioritization feedback, and translate these needs into Epics and Stories on the backlog. I would also rely on experienced developers and testers to provide architectural and design input to translate stories into clear designs, code, and tests. User stories help with the translation of user requirements and benefits into feature descriptions from a specific persona's perspective.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
- The Agile Manifesto is a good baseline of values and principles that I would take into my development approach. This includes concepts like customer engagement, a focus on working software, and collaboration, to name a few.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
- Be communicative in an efficient way, collaborate with customers and team members, be growth minded and expand your cross-functional skills, keep good architectural and design concepts in mind when coding, and commit to sprint deliverables when planning.
